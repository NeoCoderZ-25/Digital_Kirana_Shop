## 🚀 What This Project Is

This project helps **kirana shop owners go digital** without forcing them into:

- bloated enterprise software  
- overpriced SaaS tools  
- complex dashboards they won’t understand or use  

The philosophy is **brutal simplicity**.

If a feature does **not directly help sell products, manage orders, or deliver them**, it does not belong here.
